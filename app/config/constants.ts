 * Deliberately NEUTRAL. rokctai_frontend hardcodes its product name here;
 * this shell derives it from `app/site.ts`, the single source of truth it
 * already ships, so composing SDKs cannot change what the public site calls
 * itself. The layout numbers keep rokctai_frontend's values: nothing in
 * this shell renders the country superscript they position (the neutral
 * `components/custom/branding.tsx` prints the plain wordmark), so they are
 * here only so SDK code that imports them by name resolves.
